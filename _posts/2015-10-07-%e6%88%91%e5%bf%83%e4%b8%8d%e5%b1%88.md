## Unbroken – Motivation Comes From Within

“So you have to trust that the dots will somehow will connect in your future
  
You have to trust in something
  
Your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
  
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road
  
Will give you the confidence to follow your heart,
  
Even when it leads you off the well worn path.
  
And that will make all the difference.

> Your time is limited,
  
> So don’t waste it living someone else’s life

Don’t be trapped by dogma :
  
Which is living with the results of other people’s thinking
  
Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voices.
  
You’ve got to find what you love
  
And that is true for works
  
as its for your lovers
  
your work is gonna fill a large part of your life
  
And the only way to be truly satisfied
  
Is to do what you believe is great work
  
And the only way to do a great work
  
Is to love what you do
  
If you haven’t found it yet
  
Keep looking and don’t settle
  
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition
  
There somehow, already know
  
What you truly want to become.”
  
– Steve Jobs.

That you going to have some ups and you’re going to have some downs
  
Most people gave up on themselves easily
  
You know that a human spirit is powerful?
  
There is nothing as powerful – its hard to kill the human spirit!
  
Anybody can feel good when they have their health, they bills are paid, they have happy relationships
  
Anybody can be positive then,
  
Anybody can have a large of vision then
  
Anybody can have a lot of faith under those kind of circumstances

> The real challenge of growth, mentally, emotionally and spiritually
  
> Comes when you get knocked down

It takes courage to act
  
Part of being hungry when you’ve been defeated
  
It takes courage….
  
To start over again

Fear kills dream
  
Fear kills hope
  
Fear….put people in the hospital
  
Fear can age you
  
Can hold you back from doing something that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing,
  
But it will paralyzed you

At the end of your feelings is nothing,
  
But at the end of every principles is a promise
  
Behind your little feelings, it might not be absolutely nothing at the end of your little feelings
  
But behind every principles is a promise
  
And some of you in your life
  
The reason why you are not in your goal right now, because you just all about your feelings
  
All on your feelings, you don’t feel like waking up, so who does?

> Everyday you say ‘no’ to your dreams,
  
> You might be pushing your dreams back a whole six months, a whole year!

That one single day, that one day you didn’t get up could have pushed your stuff back I don’t know how long

Don’t allow your emotion to control you
  
We are emotional but we wanna begin to discipline your emotion
  
If you don’t discipline and contain your emotion, they will use you

You want it and you’re going to go all out to have it
  
Its not going to be easy, when you want to change
  
Its not easy. If it were in fact easy, everybody would do it
  
But if you’re serious, you’ll go all out

I’m in control here
  
I’m not going to let this let this get me down, I’m not going to let this destroy me!
  
I’m coming back!
  
And I’ll be stronger and better because of it
  
You have got to make a declaration
  
That this is what you stand for
  
You standing up for your dream
  
You standing up for piece of mind
  
You standing up for health
  
Take full responsibility for your life
  
Accepts where you are and the responsibility that you’re going to take yourself where you want to go
  
You can decide that I am going to live each day as if it were my last

> Live your life with passion
  
> With some drive
  
> Decide that you are going to push yourself
  
> The last chapter to your life has not been written yet

And it doesn’t matter about what happened yesterday
  
It doesn’t matter about what happened to you, what matter is
  
What are you going to do about it?

This year I will make this goal become a reality
  
I wont talk about it anymore
  
I Can
  
I Can!
  
I CAN!

To persevere I think its important for everybody
  
Don’t give up, Don’t give in
  
There’s always an answer to everything.
